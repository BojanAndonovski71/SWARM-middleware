# Robotic SWARM
Heterogeneous Underwater Code and Utility

## Project Purpose
SWARM Middleware is a robust framework designed to facilitate communication and coordination among SWARM robots. It provides a scalable, efficient, and modular middleware to enable distributed decision-making, resource-sharing, and fault-tolerant operations for SWARM systems.

## Features
Distributed Communication: Enables message passing and data synchronization across SWARM robots.
Task Allocation: Dynamic task assignment based on robot capabilities.
Fault Tolerance: Resilient to node failures with fallback mechanisms.
Modularity: Extensible architecture to integrate new sensors and actuators.
